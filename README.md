### Tools

We also have a collection of tools in the `utils` folder.

These include `createDummyData.ts` which populates the MongoDB table with some dummy data to run queries on and `rss-feed.ts` which combines the feeds from the publications listed in `publications.json`. Both scripts can be run with `ts-node <file>.ts`.
